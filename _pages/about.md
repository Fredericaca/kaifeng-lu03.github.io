Hi! I an undergraduate student in Mathematics doubling Computer Science who currently studies at the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) and will transfer to [UC Berkeley](https://math.berkeley.edu/home/) this fall. 

I am currently working as an undergraduate research assistant at [professor Kang Jian](https://jiank2.github.io/)'s lab. My research interest focuses on deep learning and information retrieval, especially on music understanding and machine vision.
